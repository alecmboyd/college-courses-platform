# FORCE DEPLOYMENT - CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION FIXES

**Deployment Status**: CRITICAL - Authentication fixes not deploying to production

**Issue**: Vercel is not automatically deploying changes from GitHub
**Solution**: Manual deployment trigger with timestamp

**Changes Ready for Production**:
- ✅ Complete authentication flow overhaul
- ✅ Login/signup functionality fixed  
- ✅ Password reset pages created
- ✅ Database initialization on first login
- ✅ Proper redirect handling after login

**Deployment Timestamp**: 2025-08-29 14:42:00 PST
**Commit Hash**: b2262bc
**Build Status**: ✅ Successful (14 routes compiled)

**Expected Result After Deployment**:
- Login page should have new design with proper authentication
- Users should be redirected to dashboard after successful login
- Password reset functionality should work without errors
- New user signup should auto-create profiles

This file is created to force Vercel to recognize and deploy the latest changes.
The production site is currently running outdated code that lacks all authentication improvements.
